Is population growth a key driver of economic growth?

Group members: Oliver King and Ufuoma Atakere

We propose to analyse the long-term relationship between a range of countries’ population growth rates and their economic growth rates to determine whether there is a statistically significant relationship.
Furthermore, we will break down population growth into its key drivers (net migration, natural birth rates, and longevity) and determine whether any of these key drivers have a statistically significant relationship with a country’s economic growth rate.
In order to communicate this to viewers, we will create a dashboard with multiple charts that update from the various datasets.
In order to collect the relevant data and create the relevant visualisations:
- We will use a Python Flask-powered API during the data gathering process.
- We will store this data in a database such as SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, or similar.
- We will use HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

After viewing our dashboard, a viewer should have a firm understanding firstly of whether, overall, a country’s population growth, or its key drivers, has a significant impact on that same country’s economic growth rate. A viewer will also be able to look into the population growth rate, the key drivers of population growth rate, and the economic growth rate for any country in the dataset.

Dataset(s) used are still TBD, but are likely to conlude one or some of the following:
- UNdata
- World Bank
- World Health Organisation
- Unicef

Visualisations to be included:
1. High vs. low population growth rate countries and their corresponding economic growth rates.
2. High vs. low net migration countries and their corresponding economic growth rates.
3. High vs. low natural birth rate countries and their corresponding economic growth rates.
4. High vs. low longevity countries and their corresponding economic growth rates.
5. Population growth summary table for a range of countries, including for each country: population growth rate, net migration rate, natural birth rate, life expectancy, economic growth rate, with a drop-down list to allow the user to select a country they’re interested in.
